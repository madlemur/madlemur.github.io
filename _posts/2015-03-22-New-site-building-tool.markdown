Getting the feel for Hexo, the tool I'm now using to build my site. I decided that as easy as using github's Jekyll was, I like the more substantial control I have using local tools. I even set up a branch just for the source, so I still have everything in github.

This doesn't mean I'm going to suddenly start posting more, just a change.
