So I decided to start putting my Arduino to good (?) use. I've gotten some LEDs, an LCD panel, and a number of switches and buttons. So far, I have KSPSerialIO talking to my Arduino, and lighting up the basic indicators (main alarm, SAS, RCS, brakes, gear, lights, abort, and connection), and I'm trying to get my LCD screen to display the apoapsis and periapsis, but something is amiss in how I'm converting the float all the way to a string.
