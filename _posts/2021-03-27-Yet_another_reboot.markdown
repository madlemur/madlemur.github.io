Hello again. It's been several years since I last posted _anything_ (and who knows, it may be years until I post again).

Rebooting into a new format, as the system I was using had become outdated, and was non-standard. So I've switched back to a more standard system that I can keep up to date with more ease.

I'll try to bring some of my Gunpla content back up to date (and maybe add some more), I'm looking to add some CNC content (much love to [V1 Engineering](https://www.v1engineering.com)), and I'm also going to work on putting up some [Sky Climbers](https://www.skyclimbers.net/) content as my involvement in the Alpha phase(s) begin to ramp up (and as any NDAs/releases allow).
